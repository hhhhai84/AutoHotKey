; Easy Access to Favorite Folders -- by Savage
; http://www.autohotkey.com

; Tested with version 1.0.23 on Win/XP

; When you click the middle mouse button while certain types of
; windows are active, this script displays a menu of your favorite
; folders.  Upon selecting a favorite, the script will instantly
; switch to that folder within the active window.  The following
; window types are supported: 1) Standard file-open or file-save
; dialogs; 2) Explorer windows; 3) Console (command prompt)
; windows; 4) Microsoft Office file Open and Save As dialogs.           ;jh0105
; The menu can also be optionally shown for unsupported window
; types, in which case the chosen favorite will be opened as a new
; Explorer window.

; Note: In Windows Explorer, if "View > Toolbars > Address Bar" is
; not enabled, the menu will not be shown if the hotkey chosen below
; has a tilde.  If it does have a tilde, the menu will be shown
; but the favorite will be opened in a new Explorer window rather
; than switching the active Explorer window to that folder.

; Menu items now point to folder shortcuts ( link files ) in the
; directory of your choice. The name of the shortcut is what appears
; in the popup menu. The shortcut's target is used to switch the
; active window.
;
; Revisions - by ChrisM
; Two menu items always appear at the bottom:
;  - Add to Favorites - allows the user to add new menu items and
; make new link files. Valid paths can be extracted from any window
; title or from the clipboard.
;  - Edit Favorites Folder - conveniently opens an explorer window
; to the link files.
; Adding numbers to the start of link file names will sort the
; menu in that order. The menu is alphabetically sorted.
;
; Added the default shortcut name as the found path with the ':' and '\' ;cm0205
; replaced with spaces to make a legal link file name.                   ;cm0205


; CONFIG: CHOOSE DIRECTORY TO HOLD SHORTCUTS
; Set the following variable to the folder name which holds all your
; folder shortcuts. The suggested place is
; %HOMEPATH%\My Documents\Favorites for easy access from other apps.
f_shortcuts_folder =%USERPROFILE%\My Documents\Favorites


; CONFIG: CHOOSE RELOADING
; Set the following variable to 1 to always reload the menu and 0 to
; disable automatic reloading. Keep this 1 unless you have a really
; long list, because it harldy takes any time to load. But if you
; don't change your list very often, then you may want to keep it 0.
f_AlwaysReload = 1


; CONFIG: CHOOSE YOUR HOTKEY
; If your mouse has more than 3 buttons, you could try using
; XButton1 (the 4th) or XButton2 (the 5th) instead of MButton.
; You could also use a modified mouse button (such as ^MButton) or
; a keyboard hotkey.  In the case of MButton, the tilde (~) prefix
; is used so that MButton's normal functionality is not lost when
; you click in other window types, such as a browser.  The presence
; of a tilde tells the script to avoid showing the menu for
; unsupported window types.  In other words, if there is no tilde,
; the hotkey will always display the menu; and upon selecting a
; favorite while an unsupported window type is active, a new
; Explorer window will be opened to display the contents of that
; folder.
f_Hotkey = ^MButton
